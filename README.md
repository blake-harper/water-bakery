# Crowdsourcing Freshwater Backend

----
## Motivation
Our project this semester supports the Georgia Tech Serve/Learn/Sustain program. More details on this program are [here](ï¿¼http://serve-learn-sustain.gatech.edu/welcome). It is loosely based on the NASA challenge [here](https://2015.spaceappschallenge.org/challenge/clean-water-mapping/).

Our application will allow water reporting to crowd sourced. People can report on locations where water is available. Users of the application can find the nearest water source or report on a new water source. Workers with test kits will also be able to report on contaminant levels. The application will provide historical graphs to show variations in water quality over time for a specific location.

A normal application like this would be networked and have a database backend. For this class, those skills are not pre-requisites, so our application will be simulated multi-user. We will assume all the data will fit into memory, so that you may store data in an appropriate basic data structure. We will persist (save the data) to disk. Making an actual networked application with a database is extra credit.

This project is for that networked extra credit.
